# Kadokadéo

## Configuration

Go to [Install the project](#install-the-project) if you need to install the project first.

Here are the configuration variables specific to the project (the standard Laravel ones, `APP_*`, `DB_*`, `QUEUE_*`..., are not listed). Most of the `KADO_*` ones are read in [`config/kado.php`](config/kado.php), whose comments give more details.

### General

| Variable                    | Description                                                                         | Default                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `SELF_URL`                  | Public URL of the site (Laravel `app.url`)                                          | `http://localhost`      |
| `KADO_GAMES_PER_DAY`        | Games allowed to play per user per day (`-1`: unlimited)                            | 100                     |
| `KADO_RUNS_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | Maximum amount of games a user can play in parallel before being throttled          | 50                      |
| `KADO_POIDS_PLUME_JACKPOT`  | Jackpot in Kado point earnt when having the maximum amount of feathers              | 0                       |
| `KADO_ACHIEVEMENTS_ENABLED` | Achievements. Off: nothing is evaluated nor shown to the players (the admin stays) | `false`                 |
| `KADO_GAME_BUILDS_ENABLED`  | Replays played by the version of the game they were recorded with (archive of the old bundles). Off for now: the production wipes `storage/` at each deploy, so every replay is played by the current bundle | `false` |
| `KADO_GAME_BUILDS_PATH`     | Folder of the archive of the old game bundles (written by `build-games.mjs`)        | `storage/app/game-builds` |

### Themes

The players can change the look of the site in « Mon compte »: the KadoKado theme for everyone, the Karbon theme (the second theme of KadoKado, `resources/css/themes/karbon.css`, images in `public/gfx/themes/karbon`) bought once with Kado points (`kado.themes` in [`config/kado.php`](config/kado.php)).

| Variable                   | Description                                  | Default |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `KADO_THEME_KARBON_PRICE`  | Price of the Karbon theme in Kado points     | 10000   |

### Clans

The tournament of the clans lasts a period (`App\Services\ClanService`), with two rankings at the same time as on KadoKado since 2011: the attacks (the score of a run becomes an attack, the attacked clan has 12 hours to beat it) and the missions (a series of games to complete within 24 hours, more games in a bigger clan, harder scores with each mission: a completed mission gives 10 points, one less every 10 missions, and opens the next one, a mission not finished in time loses a point by game not completed, minus one). Clan runs of missions are free, attacks and defenses have their own free games each day (`App\Settings\ClanSettings`, admin « Paramètres > Clans », given again by `kado:reset-daily-games`), then a paid clan game (bought by packs with Kado points, `kado.clans.game_packs`, which their owner uses or gives to his clan, distributed by the leader and the right hands). The scores, the missions and the options start again from 0 on the first day of the next period (the clans and their members stay). It is closed with the period by `kado:prepare-new-period`, and `kado:clans:resolve-attacks` (scheduled every 5 minutes) gives their points to the attacks not repelled in time. The other settings (rewards, durations...) are in `kado.clans` in [`config/kado.php`](config/kado.php).

| Variable                       | Description                                                                         | Default |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `KADO_CLANS_PROTECTION_RANGE`  | A clan can only attack the clans whose attack score is within this range of its own | 100     |
| `KADO_CLANS_BONUS_CHANCE`      | Chance (0 to 1) to win an option when the clan completes a mission                  | 0.07    |

### Security and anti-cheat

| Variable                    | Description                                                                         | Default                           |

| `KADO_REQUIRE_INPUT_PHASES` | Same, for the time of the inputs in their frame (replay v4)                         | `false`                           |
| `KADO_ANTICHEAT_SOFT_BITS`  | Bits of the client anti-cheat mask (`App\Enums\AntiCheatBit`) that only send the run to the suspicious runs queue instead of marking it as cheated (`0`: every bit marks it as cheated) | `0x3F0` |
| `KADO_SUSPICION`            | Evaluation of every finished run for the admin queue « Runs suspectes » (`App\Services\SuspicionService`, nothing is sanctioned automatically) | `true` |

### Replay verifier

The replays of the runs that count (personal best, contract, daily game) are played again on the server in a headless Chrome (`App\Jobs\VerifyRunReplay`, needs Node 22+ and Chrome or its system libraries).

| Variable                               | Description                                                                         | Default                         |

| `KADO_REPLAY_VERIFIER_UNTRUSTED_GAMES` | Comma-separated game keys whose replays sometimes end differently from the live game: a different score is only reported, not sanctioned | |

### Replay analysis

Per-game analyzers of the moves (`resources/js/replay-verifier/analyzers/<game_key>.mjs`), run by the replay verifier.
